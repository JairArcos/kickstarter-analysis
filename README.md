# kickstarter-analysis
Model 1. Challenge (kickstarter-analysis)

**Overview of Project.**

This project was developped to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

**Analysis and Challenges.**

Theater outcome vs Launch analysis (Table 1) showed higher succcessful event rather than failed or cancelled, nonetheless, there is a lack of 39% convining failed or cancelled events, for sure there is a really great opportunity to improve our numbers. Also, what we could see is a falling succcess event trend in the second half of the years. Splitting data into Years (Graph 2) it was observed that events started to have a great increase from 2013 to 2014, remaining stable during 3 years and having hard time in 2017 with one of the lower performances.

Analysis outcomes per theater/plays it was confirmed a higher failed rate in goal from $15,000 to $34,500 and higher than $45,000.

The top 3 of events where no successful is being observed are: technology/web (160 events: 37.50% of them failed and 62,50% cancelled), food/food trucks (140 events: 85.71% failed and 14.29% canceled) and the last one games/video games (100 events: 100% failed). Events that are not being successfull should be evaluated to identified opportinities and if they are worth it to keep investing, what are the drivers that are causing unprofitable results? it is one of the most important challenge to improve our numbers.

**Results**

Impact reduction was observed on 2017, there are some event that are not profitable, opportunities should be identified that find where resources should be allocated and which other should not be done.
